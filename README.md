## _`Synchronous vs Asynchronous programming`_

## _`Synchronous`_
### Synchronous code runs in sequence. This means that each operation must wait for the previous one to complete before executing.


## _`Asynchronous`_

### Asynchronous code runs in parallel. This means that an operation can occur while another one is still being processed.

## _`SetTimeout()`_

### The setTimeout() method executes a block of code after the specified time. The method executes the code only once.




##  _`CallBack`_

### A function is a block of code that performs a certain task when called.


## `Promise`

### The Promise() constructor takes a function as an argument. The function also accepts two functions resolve() and reject().
### To create a promise object, we use the Promise() constructor.


## `Try/catch/finally`

### The try...catch statement is comprised of a try block and either a catch block, a finally block, or both. The code in the try block is executed first, and if it throws an exception, the code in the catch block will be executed.


## `async function`

### The async function declaration declares an async function where the await keyword is permitted within the function body. The async and await keywords enable asynchronous, promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner style, avoiding the need to explicitly configure promise chains.

## `Async await`

### The await keyword is used inside the async function to wait for the asynchronous operation.
### The use of await pauses the async function until the promise returns a result (resolve or reject) value


## `Catch()`

### While using the async function, you write the code in a synchronous manner. And you can also use the catch() method to catch the error.
